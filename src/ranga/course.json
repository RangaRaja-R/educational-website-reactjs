    "longdetails": "In the last few years, Blockchain technology has generated massive interest among governments, enterprises, and academics, because of its capability of providing a transparent, secured, tamper-proof solution for interconnecting different stakeholders in a trustless setup. In January 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY), Government of India, published the first draft of the \"National Strategy on Blockchain\" that highlights 17 potential applications that are of national interest. Against this backdrop, this subject will cover the basic design principles of Blockchain technology and its applications over different sectors. Additionally, the course also provides tutorials on setting up blockchain applications using one of the well-adopted permissionless blockchain platforms - Ethereum, and one permissioned blockchain platform - Hyperledger.",
